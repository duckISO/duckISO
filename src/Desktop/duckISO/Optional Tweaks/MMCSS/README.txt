This driver basically allows applications to proritise certain threads (like audio) to ensure that there's no issues with audio stuttering and other stuff like that.
It is recommended to keep it enabled, not a lot of applications use MMCSS, but you can experience issues without it.

It doesn't really use any CPU usage from my experience.
